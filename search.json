    "text": "Some tools that have been particularly impactful for the teams I‚Äôve worked with:\n\nData validation dashboards\nTo foster collaborative data science with diverse teams including members without quantitative backgrounds, I generate dynamic and interactive Data Validation Dashboards using R, Java, CSS, and HTML. I have deployed these dashboards with great success in Liberia and Madagascar. These dashboards allow all team members to:\n\nTrack study progress as new data is collected and identify new samples to collect\nCatch and revise data validation errors in real-time with automated queries\nAccess descriptive statistics and visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject tracking in GitHub\nTo facilitate team coding projects for scientists of varying comfort levels with Git, I created a GUI project tracking dashboard for scientists on our international Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases team. Team members can:\n\nTrack projects as they move from conceptualization to varying stages of publication\nAssign other members to tasks related to specific projects\nEasily access GitHub repositories for relevant projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming network automation\nIn social network analysis, researchers commonly deploy name-generating questions to develop an individual‚Äôs social network. To keep track of unique names, researchers often ask participants to provide phone numbers or email addresses of the people they name. In rural, remote contexts, though, individuals often do not have phones or internet, and they may provide names or nicknames with inconsistent spellings. Using methods from statistics and computer science, I created an automated tool to assign edges between individuals named in a social network. This tool:\n\nAutomatically cleans and standardizes name data provided in name-generating questions\nUses Jaro-Winkler and Jaccard algorithms to assign similarly spelled names to unique participant identification numbers (‚Äúsocial_netid‚Äù)\nGenerates dynamic network visualizations as new name data is added and unique individuals are assigned to nodes"

    "text": "Direct and indirect contact between humans and animals remain the most fundamental and modifiable drivers of cross-species pathogen transmission. Remarkably, though, we lack an understanding of what predicts these zoonotic interactions, particularly in rural contexts at the frontline of many zoonoses. We use graph modeling with network simulations to identify the drivers of human-animal contact and zoonotic interactions in rural Madagascar. This research allows us to use demographic traits to guide public health education interventions in resource-limited settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-led with Dr.¬†Camille DeSisto\n\n\n\nHookworms infect over half a billion people around the world. In resource-limited contexts, hookworm infection can be energetically draining; it may also regulate inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk. In this project, I use structural equation modeling to investigate the energetic and immunoregulatory pathways by which different hookworm species influence nutrition status and blood pressure to produce different health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisgust is hypothesized to be an evolved behavior to regulate avoidance of dangerous stimuli, especially pathogens. Yet, there is limited direct evidence that disgust actually improves fitness by promoting health behaviors that reduce exposures to parasites. I leverage Bayesian approaches with survey and laboratory data to model how disgust impacts viral exposures and immune activation."
