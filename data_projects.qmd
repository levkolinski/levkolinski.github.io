## Professional Experience
My expertise is collaborative data science for international biological and human health research. I have led data curation and coding projects in my roles:

[**at the University of Michigan**](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/capuchin/)

-   I oversaw wild primate endocrinology research in Costa Rica
-   Curated and maintained longitudinal biological dataset with thousands of observations
-   Trained graduate students and field technicians in molecular laboratory methods and data analysis

[**at EcoHealth Alliance**](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/whats-the-fever)

-   I worked as a researcher and project manager for a U.S. Department of Defense, "Reducing the threat of acute-febrile illness causing pathogens in Liberia"
-   Oversaw human and animal biological research across Liberia
-   Established automated data management systems to validate and curate survey and laboratory datasets
-   Trained Liberian researchers on data visualization

[**at Duke University**](https://sites.duke.edu/bassmadagascar/output-and-outcomes/market-integration-land-use-and-pathogen-transmission-in-rural-madagascar/):

-   I am the data scientist for a National Science Foundation Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases grant, "Market Integration, Land Use, and Pathogen Transmission in Rural Madagascar"
-   Oversee coding projects, data and code curation, and project management for researchers across the United States, Singapore, RÃ©union, and Madagascar

## Some tools that have been particularly impactful to the teams I've worked with:

#### Data Validation Dashboards

To foster collaborative data science with diverse teams including members without quantitative backgrounds, I generate dynamic and interactive Data Validation Dashboards using R, Java, CSS, and HTML. I have deployed these dashboards with great success in Liberia and Madagascar. These dashboards allow all team members to:

-   Track study progress as new data is collected and identify new samples to collect
-   Catch and revise data validation errors in real-time with automated queries
-   Access descriptive statistics and visualizations

#### Project Tracking in GitHub

To facilitate team coding projects for scientists of varying comfort levels with Git, I created a GUI project tracking dashboard for scientists on our international Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases team. Team members can:

-   Track projects as they move from conceptualization to varying stages of publication
-   Assign other members to tasks related to specific projects
-   Easily access GitHub repositories for relevant projects

#### Naming Network Automation

In social network analysis, researchers commonly deploy name-generating questions to develop an individual's social network. To keep track of unique names, researchers often ask participants to provide phone numbers or email addresses of the people they name.In rural, remote contexts, though, individuals often do not have phones or internet, and they may provide names or nicknames with inconsistent spellings. Using methods from statistics and computer science, I created an automated tool to assign edges between individuals named in a social network. This tool:

-   Automatically cleans and standardized name data provided in name-generating questions
-   Uses Jaro-Winkler and Jaccard algorithms to assign similarly spelled names to unique participant identification numbers ("social_netid")
-   Generates dynamic network visualizations as new name data is added and unique individuals are assigned to nodes
